    "text": "I will in my review try to answer a few questions that I am seeing in Q & A section.Hope it helps !Q: Is this some magic oil that will automatically get me a beard where there are no hair follicles?Ans  No, eg; if you put this oil on your forehead, a beard will not grow on your forehead, as there are no follicles there.This oil will only help if you have hair follicles and they can be hydrated and strengthened. So if you are looking for a hair loss remedy , this will not work.What can I use this oil for?Ans  If you plan to grow a beard after the initial 15 day itch, you will find that your skin becomes dry and itchy.Also the beard starts growing wild and makes you look like a homeless person, thats when the mothers and wives are hounding us to shave off the beard.This oil will help you tame your beard and hydrate the skin below the beard to make it shiny, manageable and well groomed.When should I apply the oil?Ans  The best time to apply the oil is right after a bath and after you have dried your beard with a towel, as the hair is soft and you can reach the skin below and the pores will be open and absorb the oil.How much oil should I use?Ans- the quantity really depends on the size of the beard and the climate that you live in. If you live in a dry and cold climate and you have a long beard you can use 3  5 drops. With my size of beard I use 3-4 drops , as the idea is to hydrate the beard and not clog the pores , by using too much oil.How should I use the oil on my beard?Ans  take a few drops on the palm of your hand, Rub the beard oil into your hand, then massage it throughout your beard.If your beard is longer, use a comb (preferably a wooden comb, as plastic destroys the beard) to make sure the product covers every hair and moisturizes your skin.Use your finger tips to coat the hairs on your mustache. After applying the oil , I personally use a boar bristle brush which has given me amazing results. How many times should I oil my beard?Ans  that again like I mentioned earlier depends on the climate , length of the beard, type of skin. Start with alternate days and then if it suits you , you can decide accordingly. Not all beards are the same, so you will have to experiment to find whats right for you.Now that Ive got that out of the way.on to the product.This oil has sesame oil, rose, hibiscus, vitamin b6 as ingredients which will air hair growth.The bottle comes is neat packaging and has a dropper, so it makes it easy get the oil on the palms.The fragrance is pleasant and not too over-powering.I like the  bottle which is useful to carry along when travelling.The only con I feel is that it should have a pump so oil dispensing becomes easy and spill proof, but then again its not a deal breaker.I find my beard much better to manage and groom and I would definitely recommend this one."

This book changed my Way of Thinking about my own Self, and so, is not just an ordinary self-help book.3. The author has enriched this book with Life-Changing quotes, and has explained them to us by simple Daily-life examples.4. The book is very helpful for you, if you are struggling to control your Thoughts, Emotions and Feelings. The author has explained in plain  easy words- how to Control your Mind.5. This book has brought quite some changes to my behaviour and habits, and hopefully it will be helpful for you too in your journey to achieve  what YOU want.6. The quality of pages is very good, even at this low price offered by Amazon.7. Delivery services by Amazon was Very Good.  Cons:1. The book is a bit lengthy, so you will have to be a little patient so that you can complete reading this book.  I read this book in a week, and am FULLY satisfied with the product. Probably one of the world's best Self-Help books ever written. So, you can go for it Without any doubt.  If you like the review, please give us a Helpful vote below- it helps."

There are plenty of the examples in this book which are not provided with evidence and clearly based upon the understanding of the events by the author. You can choose examples such as \"Woman who dreamed of Cadilac because her uncle died and left fortunes for her\" and \"Girl who got the necklace she wanted\". Use your own judgement before going by the sequence of events mentioned in the book. As Joseph Murphy was PhD in Psychology, he clearly knew what people want in life and that's why he wrote about the things which people crave most. That is Health, Wealth and Relationships.Also, the big low of this book is how it takes away the power of getting things done, Power of hard work, Power of Determination and clearly focuses just on mind. In other words, think good and you are playing your role perfectly. The author mentions \"Law of Attraction\" as well which is a big turnoff in the form presented in the book.To conclude, the idea is \"Think good, Do good\" and indulge in what you want to achieve and you will succeed."

The book is divided into 20 chapters ranging from various topics like fear, happiness, success, etc. At the onset the book seems an interesting read but as one progresses further, it becomes more and more redundant and mundane. Word of Caution before reading and buying this book:1. No scientific explanation and no reference to any research in this area2. More of religious and personal beliefs of the author which may be unpalatable to readers of different faith and fact-dependent minds. It would have been better to explore the subject with the perspective of other faiths to attract more readers and understand the subject in totality by keeping others interest in mind.2. Too much serving of bible in the ending chapters specially 18th, 19th and 20th. I could barely maintain my patience to go through every word in these chapters3. Author has shared few of his experiences with other people but no proof to substantiate the facts4. Do not read if one has already read 'The Secret' by Rhonda Byrne5. Read only if you haven't read any book on the subject before.6. Read Bible - 'New Testament' or 'Geeta' instead. Bible talks about the faith. An unshakable faith that could really do wonders if only you can first explore inside and trust yourself completely before entrusting anyone else for your feelings, emotions or any material possession.7. I don't understand how this book is an International bestseller. Next time I would make sure to do some home-work before relying on Amazon's bestseller/ International Bestseller status of the book.Read only if:1. Feeling low and demotivated in life2. Have faith in the working of the mystical working of the universe or God the creator (Infinite Intelligence)3. You are thoughtful, introspective and good at imagining things4. If you work towards self-improvement and wish for others well beingMoral of the Story: Self-belief is important for everything you desire in your life."

    "text": "Light weight.handy.indian product with decent performance for this price segment of 10k.Hi, it was the awesome product from Mi. Buy Redmi 4 amazon is going for sale on 23rd May at 12Pm it would be similar to Redmi note 4. the phone is released in 3 variants based on RAM & ROM. Redmi 4 with 2GB RAM +16GB storage at Rs 6,999, the Redmi 4 with 3GB RAM+32GB storage at Rs 8,999, and finally Redmi 4 with 4GB RAM+64GB storage at Rs 10,999.Xiaomi has taken one step further by introducing a 64GB storage variant for its budget smartphone. Redmi 4 now comes in a matte black variant, similar to the Redmi Note 4, and theres a gold color variant as well.Design, DisplayRedmi 4 is like a mini version of the Redmi Note 4. This phone sports a metal uni-body design similar to the Redmi Note 4 series, except this one has a 5-inch HD display compared to the formers 5.5-inch full HD one.The dual, CNC-drilled speakers are now at the bottom of the device, and in the middle is the micro-USB port. It has a slightly curved back with antenna bands running on top and the bottom; the headphone jack is on top of the phone.Overall, the 5-inch form factor makes this a very compact device to hold. However, the Redmi 4 is prone to picking up smudges, especially on the back. So get a cover and tempered glass for the front as well to avoid screen disasters. For those who like a 5-inch phone, the Redmi 4 remains a good-looking option to consider. Redmi 4 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor.On the display front, this one sports a 5-inch HD display, which works well in all lighting conditions, even bright sunlight. For a budget phone, this is one of the better displays you can get in the market.Specifications, PerformanceIve been using the Redmi 4 for the past couple of days, and so far I wouldnt say general performance is an issue. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 435 processor and has 3GB RAM + 32GB storage, which can be expanded via a microSD card.For your daily social media consumption, be it YouTube or Facebook, or daily messaging, this phone is good enough. It performs the basic tasks without any hiccups.CameraRedmi 4 comes with a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. The front camera is acceptable I would say, though the software kept tagging me as a 44-year-old male, which is not very flattering. The rear camera is not the fastest, and while colours like red appear a bit washed out, the overall picture composition is not so bad.Overall, I would say the camera is pretty standard on the Redmi 4, and delivers a good experience given the price of the phone. On the low-light shots, I still have to test out this phone some more.BatteryXiaomi has made this the USP of the Redmi series. Redmi 4 has a 4100 mAh battery, which will easily last a day. However, there is no fast-charging and the phone takes a good three hours plus to get to 100 per cent. But even if you charge this phone at 50 per cent, you should be able to get more than a day with moderate to heavy usage."

The scan app and virus app is only for internal memory and not the memory card. I will keep this phone under observation for a day more before I initiate an exchange. Out of two bottom speakers only one works fine. Is this an issue?Previous update:Though the phone boasts of a 4GB ram,  the available Ram is never more than 2GB. Mind you I received this phone a few hours ago and it has just the preloaded aps. It took more than 3hours for the phone to charge fully.  The cam did not look like a 13mp. I will post an updated review in a few days once I've tested it thoroughly."

Android Nougat with Miui 9 which gives you a great experience just like stock android.  3. 4100 Mah large battery with 5 inch screen and efficient processor gives you longer battery life.  4. Fingerprint sensor with other necessary sensors.Cons: 1. 4100 Mah battery but no fast charging, so it takes much time to full charge the battery.  2. Camera quality is average.  3. Hybrid slots for sim and sd card.Although it has some cons but compared to its price and specifications it is a very good phone at this price range. But it is preferable to buy either 32 or 64 Gb varient so that you don't run out of space."

However too many bloatwares are installed. Although some of them can be disabled or uninstalled, but still there will be many which can't be disabled. Redmi UI is not that impressive. Better to insall a 3rd party launcher like Nova. It gets heated up while charging the phone due to metallic body. The most seducing factor of this phone is fingerprint sensor which unlocks the phone within a second. Only con is that it has Hybrid SIM slot. Otherwise it is superb. Close your eyes and go for it."

One of the best and unique features is Mi Remote, basically and Infrared Blaster with an app to control your TV/Set Top box, AC and much more. The fingerprint scanner is very fast and pretty accurate. MIUI8 is awesome frankly I find it better than stock android. A lot of the higher end phones are getting rid of FM and even the audio jack ....that's not the case here. The only thing missing as per me is Corning Gorilla glass, so I would advise buyers to purchase a tempered glass cover as a precaution. The other thing is there is one speaker at the bottom of the phone, but it looks like there are two. Well the one on the right is the speaker and the one on the left is the Mic. Rest assured this is a good phone and won't drill a hole in your pocket. If on the other hand you want to go for a high-end option from Xiaomi then wait for Mi Mix 2 ;)"

It is disorienting at first, but you impulsively know where your thumb needs to go after a few days of usage.The Redmi 4 might be a budget phone but theres no compromise on the aesthetics. In fact, with this outing  like before  the company sets the standards for what affordable smartphones should look and feel like in 2017.DisplayThe Redmi 4 sports a 5-inch HD display with a 1280 x 720 resolution. Theres a 2.5D curved glass, similar to the Redmi Note 4. Its toughened glass, although theres no Gorilla Glass protection.While the specifications sheet watchers wouldve liked a Full HD display, I think it wouldve been an overkill on a 5-inch budget smartphone and obviously hurt the battery life.The HD display nevertheless looks fantastic in terms of color reproduction and viewing angles. The images and text looks sharp, and it is clearly one of the best displays on smartphones in this price segment. Maintaining a perfect balance, it is a crisp and vivid display without the colors looking oversaturated.PerformancePowered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz coupled with Adreno 505 GPU, the Redmi 4 comes in three memory variants  theres one with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage, another one with 3 GB of RAM along with 32 GB of storage, and the top variant with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage.The mid variant that I used for this review had just over 25 GB free memory out-of-the box.The Snapdragon 435 is a pretty snappy chip, and the Redmi 4 chugs along nicely in daily usage. In my three weeks of usage, I havent really encountered any sluggishness or lags. You can also play most of the graphic-intensive games, albeit with a few frame skips here and there or graphic settings turned down. One of the impressive things is that even while gaming, the phone did not get hot.The 4,100 mAh battery on the Redmi 4 saves you from the constant battery anxiety. A day and a half on a single charge is easily manageable for most casual users which is impressive really. Even on moderate to higher usage, the phone managed to offer more than a day of battery life.HardwareJust like the Redmi Note 4, the Redmi 4 packs in an IR blaster that you can configure to use your phone as a remote control for several electronic appliances at your home. The fingerprint scanner located at the back is quite good, and apart from authentication, can also be used to take photos, especially those selfies.The dual SIM smartphone features a hybrid slot, so essentially, you can either use two SIM cards or one SIM card and one microSD card. If you need to use two SIMs and are a content hog, maybe youd like to opt for the top variant that offers 64 GB internal storage.While the battery life on the Redmi 4 is stellar, it is disappointing that there is no fast charging support on the device. The issue is magnified in phones which pack in larger batteries because it takes even longer to charge the phone completely.CameraXiaomi Redmi 4 packs a 13MP rear camera with LED flash that can manage some great shots with good color reproduction and sharpness.Outdoors in daylight, the phone really surprises with details it manages to capture and overall clarity. Even the macro shots and close-up portraits turn out to be great. The PDAF works quite well and the camera focuses on subjects in a snap.In low light, the camera manages to click some decent shots, but theres a lot of noise in the pictures. Even indoors, the photos take a hit and are average at best. But this is a budget smartphone were talking about and it does better than what most in this segment manage to achieve.Xiaomi deserves credit for its impressive camera algorithms that makes the Redmi 4 a fast and dependable shooter.The 5-megapixel front-facing camera manages decent selfies that are good enough for social sharing. Theres nothing special there, although most would not expect that anyway.I thought that there is no mobile ever made till now just like it in such low price."

There is no solution provided despite continues requests through MIUI forum.I bought redmi note 4  6 months before and recently this phone. Noise cancellation is too much...if you are a singer you can't record your singing as it will sound horrible due to noise cancellation...there is no solution for this issue so far. I regret buying this phone. And I won't recommend xioami phones as they don't care about existing customers.

Yet with positive hope, ordered this and to my surprise I got delivered with a phone that gets super hearted when connected to charging. Both the device and the charger tends to heat rapidly. Complained to customer service explaining this matter , but they dismissing to make the refund. Experiencing worst customer service from them since last couple of days. Absolute disappointment to experience such a failure from my most loved company Amazon. Decided not to do online shopping with these guys henceforth for having gone through mental traume in dealing up with them"

The fingerprint scanner works well.For the people complaining that the camera quality will be mid line, all I can say is if you want a good camera, then buy a good camera. Not a phone.

Believe me, you will never regret buying this phone.I wouldn't mention the below points as cons as you already have the needed specification for the given budget.

You can definitely go with this product.Also you get 3 different ear buds with size Small, Medium & Large which helps you to get comfort."

    "text": "If I had to give one word for these earphones, it'll be Amazing! I've just received them and this write up will be the initial impressions they had on me. To all those who are very serious about spending their money on reliable earphones, can Zero In on these.1. Their delivery is loud enough that I didn't even need to surpass the volume past the half mark.2. Even after being a bass addict, I had to put the equalizer of my player on 'balanced'. The bass is so on point that you would be satisfied.3. The treble and the vocals are not compromised by the bass. You will even be able to listen to musical instruments/ electronic beats being played that you never did before.4. Music can be paused and played by clicking the button once and the track can be skipped by double clicking so dont worry about that. I read, someone in the question / answers had mentioned it doesn't but that's not true. It does perform the function of taking and disconnecting calls, needless to say.5. The wire is long enough to fit into the trouser pockets without tension and is of good rubbery quality. Its not glossy and seems like it won't tangle easily. The earphones are light weight as well. Won't fall off during jogging.6. The noise cancellation is up to the mark.7. The call mic is good as well.8. The music seems more pleasant on these whichever genre it may be. I have it all, from Queen to Metallica to Ed Sheeran to Marshall Mathers to Coke Studio to Gurubaani.9. I experienced a little pain in my ears and back of my head after an hour of listening songs though. I'd recommend you to use these with intervals. There's another downside of these, it's that the connector (from where the wire connects to the aux of earphones) seems weak on the first look. May break if handled aggressively. (That's why I gave it a star less)The delivery was quick and before due date. This review will be updated on the day these earphones malfunction (if ever)"

I will Discuss all the Questions asked Above and will also Tell you How to Identify The Fake Product. And will give you a Solution For Best Performance.  Lets Begin the Review :================UNBOXING REVIEW :================1 -  EARPHONE2- WARRANTY CARD3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS4- MANUALS=================EARPHONE REVIEW :  (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money  )=================4* out of 5  for Premium Looks.4* out of 5 for Build Quality.4* out of 5 for Comfortable.3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.3* out of 5 for Treble.3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality==============================ADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :===============================1-  Premium Looks at this price Range2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.3- JBL is a trusted Brand.4- Good Comfortable while Listening.5- It has a Mic .6- Warranty Of 1 year.===========================================WHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money =3.5*============================================I got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.1-  Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.4- If You are really a  Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.=======================How To check Fake Product :=======================Step 1-  In front of the Box  , Under C100SI you will see its Written \"In EAR HEADPHONES\".  It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker.  Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.=================================How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :=================================If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality,  i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.=============CONCLUSION :=============This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if  this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY -= 3.5 *============MY OPINION :============IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic  Mi In ear.If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.I have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews, Go to my profile and check the Reviews..=====================Was my Review HELPFUL :======================I hope i have Discussed all the questions asked above. If you still have some, You can comment Below .i will Help you as soon as possible.Sorry For this Long Review, Thanks For Your Patience. Have a Safe and Productive Day ahead. Jai ."

Initially, for first few months, it appeared to be great product (as it was my first JBL purchase) but over a period of time, I realized that sound levels of two ear phones are different (right ear phone has much lower sound level than left).This quality compromise is not at all expected from brand like JBL. I feel cheated from JBL now. Hope other buyers will learn from my experience hence this product review after 1 year of purchase."

Very comfortable and lite weight i wear this earphones listing mild music for almost 5 hrs but still my ears weren't bothered unlike Boat earphones which were so heavy that i used to remove them after half hr.2. Best sound. of course this is the trade mark of JBL earphones3. Value for money. the pair of earphones i purchased at Rs. 710 (100 bucks extra as compared to boat earphones) which way way more worth than boat earphones.4. Build quality. although it would seem like the earphones are delicate, yet it has the nice build quality. of course you have to be careful when you are in a rush (like Mumbai Local train) otherwise it has good quality cables.The only con is that there are only 2 colour options (Black and White). the only side where Boat and JBL earphones win. seriously i am a big fan of colour combo like Blue and Black, Red and Black or yellow and white. but, this would be subjective for different buyers.If you want a great earphones at the price of less than 1,000, go grab this instead of wasting your time on reading my feedback.:)"

The sound quality of the earphones are really nice. Comes with 3 sets of earplugs of different shapes. Once you plug these earphone, outside noise is not a problem anymore. Has very balanced sound. The bass, treble all has all been tweaked properly so get a decent sound.The mic on this is superb.Overall an excellent product. Highly recommended."

I decided for JBL after lots of R&D.; After using iPhones earphone I thought JBL wont match its level but believe me it does. Not exactly same but its quite close.It has high powerful bass, clear mic sound quality, perfect for iPhone devices.Cons-The only negative point I can see in this earphone, the mic is placed little lower ( little far from mouth), you may have to put little effort while making calls. However I tested by making calls, no issues. You need not to hold mic near your mouth during calls.So I highly recommend this earphone. I bought this one in just 799/- with 75 cashback in pay balance. Always grateful for amazing Amazon. Loved it!!!"

    "text": "First thing, I got the notification regarding delivery of earphones on Sunday even though I had not received them! I contacted customer service and the lady assured me not to worry as the delivery partner had scanned wrong code for wrong delivery. It happened with me for the second time. First time was few months ago when I had ordered kaspersky antivirus. I think they do it on purpose to boast about fast delivery record!Anyways, the earphones arrived 2 days later and the first impression regarding delivery wasn't so good as there was simple plastic bag without bubble wrap, probably because product costed less. Still, I don't think it would've costed Amazon too much to add bubble wrap.Earphones were in a plastic box, so they were safe anyway, but bubble wrap is a nice touch, so I request Amazon to add it again even for deliveries under 1k. The plastic box was also not properly sealed on both sides (no tape or anything on one side. Could easily open in 1 second). Thus, at first I suspected a used product but earphones were tucked inside properly like new pair and also didn't feel like used when took them out. I'd recommend proper sealing to manufacturers, just to eliminate doubt!Earphones are not so sturdy looking. A thin wire as compared to my previous earphones which came with my Nexus 5. They lasted 3.5 years and were nice.Performance wise, bass is just about OK, treble is more pronounced and mids sound flat. Voice of artists and mid notes lack punch. If you intend to listen to voice details in songs like classical singing, natyageet, bhaktigeet, or rate voice of an artist like Arijit, Anand Bhate, Mahesh Kale, Rahul Deshpande above music, then you'd be a little disappointed.Of course, I am saying this because I also own Sennheiser HD 202 II headphones and they are just amazing for sound details, clarity and overall sound experience. I understand that these two are from totally seperate catagories. But I just want to say, if sound (and specially voice in songs) is of utmost importance to you, please try different brand, preferably Sennheiser.Mic is good. Made couple of calls and the other person could hear me perfectly without issues. Changed songs with the button (play, pause, next, previous everything worked well). At home, I use Sennheiser HD 202 II. I bought these mainly to use them when I go for a walk so that I can listen to songs and receive calls. They serve their purpose well...therefore gave 4 stars!Comfort level is good. I am typing this review with earphones in my ears, and I've been wearing these since past 1.5 hrs. Medium level plugs that were present on earphones as default are good enough for me. Haven't tried small and big ones.I take good care of my earphones and that's why my previous ones lasted 3.5 years. I don't have high hopes form this Jbl pair though. Let's see!Finally, these are good earphones from a reputed brand for general purpose, don't expect anything special!Special Note: These are made in China, its mentioned on box and also on a tag on earphone wire. So if you have decided to stop buying China manufacturerd products, stay away regardless of cost, quality, comfort, warranty."

Its been a month since I started using these and I'm satisfied as of now.So the first look of the product wasn't great, it looks like some fake Chinese earphones. But once plugged in, it's a beast. So performance wise, this is one of the best you will find in the range. Now it depends on your preference what you want to value more. A quick Summary:Bass: 9/10Treble: 9/10Vocals: 8/10Outside Noise Reduction: 8/10Microphone quality: 9/10Comfort: 9/10Build Quality: 8/10Looks: 7/10Overall Performance: 9/10Overall appearance: 7.5/10Decision: Your call what you value more. Appearance wise, you may find better looking earphones in the price range. But if you re indifferent to how they look and focus is more on performance, then these are on of the best you will find.P.S.: They entangle like any other earphone. No innovation on this end. :)"

They fit perfectly in my ear and are very light n comfortable for long hours. The sound is balanced with fairly distinct highs, lows n mids reproduction. The bass is abundant yet tight. Wires are a little thin n seem delicate but there has been no noticeable wear n tear even after months of usage. I picked them for Rs 599. Simply brilliant for that price.

I am using this powder by keeping it in small airtight containers of 500 gram each. As the packet is very big so it is not handy if it falls from your hand on the floor then it will crack and detergent powder will be wasted on the floor.I highly recommend this product you this product for your daily wash. To remove tough stains use little bit of more Surf Excel easy wash detergent powder in 40 degree Celsius water."

    "text": "When I got this chopper, I was so disappointed with the size. I was trying so hard to figure out the blade placement, closing the lid tightly and all. The first thing I tried was chopping cabbage. I had a feeling I would chop it faster. I thought this would be eating dust in some corner of my kitchen. But, no! I was so wrong.This chopper comes with a removable 3-blade attachment and all removable and washable parts. This means that you also can use it as a bowl after chopping. I finally found its use when I used it to make tomato paste, onion paste, crush peanuts and making palak paneer gravy, finely chopped garlic and chillies.Don't underestimate the size. I don't have a mixer yet and this has saved my life when it comes to making basic Indian gravy dishes. This is great if you stay in a PG or you are a bachelor and cook your own food.PROS:- Really inexpensive- Removable and washable parts- 3 sharp blades- Versatile (chopper base can be used a bowl)- Easy to put together and operate (just pull the string)- Easy to wash and store- Chop vegetables, herbs, fruits, dry fruits and nuts- Make Puree, Paste and MashCONS:- Size is small (but again, don't go just by the size)USAGE TIPS:- Halve or chop the vegetables roughly to fit in the chopper.- Shake the chopper to shift the vegetables if you are having a hard time pulling the string.- Don't put too much at once especially if you are using it for chopping cabbage or a hard vegetable. If you put too much, you won't be able to fit the blade properly and the lid won't close with that click sound. Fit the blade first and then put your vegetable.Totally Recommended!"

Whats matters most is RPM and BPM. While using on concrete it doesnt even feel like its getting stuck or putting more force. Using it is a breeze. I installed mirror in bathroom drilling the tiles, a fan in my tv cabinet drilling wood and also passed LAN cable through walling by drilling in concrete from both sides. Best product."

Both the products had same problem. The chuck was misaligned, hence the point of drill bit was wobbling like hell.6. Then I checked the product at the local store, and found the same problem in 5 different machines from BOSCH. All of them had a wobbling chuck, and the shopkeeper said, these days almost all the products are like that. Use for a while and throw.

The drill chuck had noticeable amount of wobble. Things got worse after hooking up the screw driver bits. The wobble caused entire drill to shake while drilling and slip while screwing/unscrewing.I tried to google to see if chuck wobble was normal. Based on feedback across different forums, minor/negligible amount of wobble may be present in a drill. Typically it is considered acceptable. However if the wobbling is clearly visible to naked eye and also feels/vibrates during operation in a brand new machine then it is totally unacceptable. This is referred to as \"run-out\" and will eventually cause the machine to break-down. Based on the info collected, I finally decided to return for a refund.It is difficult to believe that a company as reputed as bosch is manufacturing such sub-standard products in India."

I was surprised to see the SIZE of the guitar, I'd say about half the size of a normal guitar (meaning it's more for a 7 to 10 years old}.I wish the seller was more direct to mention this. I definitely WON'T HAVE BOUGHT this if i knew the size was so small. I'll surely down vote the seller if possible.3. Guitar was undamaged4. Guitar came with a pair of cheap but usable plectrums, a set of steel strings, a synthetic material strap and a cheap looking plasticy carry bag.5. There is only one knob to sling the guitar strap (on the right side of the guitar) and the guitar strap is completely USELESS without being unable to be attached to 2 sides.6. Playing the guitar.... On such a small guitar, I expected toy like sound. However, they were playable and most keys were sort of acceptable. But since the strings were high, fingers hurts quickly.Also I noted that chords played closer to the body of the guitar tends to sound muffled and off tune.7. Finally, I am going to keep the guitar just in case my son (2 years 4 months now) may learn guitar when he grows up.To be honest, I am pissed that such an important fact was HIDDEN from buyers.As I said, I won't have bought this if I knew the size of this guitar"

I have fairly large size hands (I'm 6ft high). Although it did take a bit of time to get used to the small cube, coming from years of using large cubes, was fairly easy.Pros :Smooth turningPerfect size for any size handsVery little to No maintainanceCons :The logo of the manufacturer is a bit distracting (It's on the centerpiece of the white face)Verdict : Although there is only one major con that I can point out with the cube, it is fairly easy to remove the logo with a razor blade and 5 minutes of work. If you are looking to getting into speed solving, or just solving in general, this is a very good place to start off."

Genuine product. Good quality packing. Purchase from genuine seller like cloudtail for assurance of genuine product. All apple softwares works finely. Must buy in this range you wont get a better laptop than macbook air. Light and sleek. Synchronises my iphone with it. Like you can call anyone from your macbook and even pick calls from your mac if your phone is in sync with macbook air. Apple lovers go for it."

The 3 Rs of a seller - Ratings (here 98% positive), Reviews (here almost all positive) and Research (continue reading)...Appario Retail Private Limited is a joint venture between Amazon and Patni founders. Not that this should be blindly enough , but enough to mean that if Amazon itself is a stakeowner then you can rest assured to get the best in class service and product both in terms of delivery and quality. Further , with a capital of approx USD $42 million already raised , youre sure the seller isnt going away in just an year since its inception in 2017Delivery and Seller experience - Super delivery by Amazon (Prime). Ordered on 24th Jan at 4pm and got it the next day at 1pm , thats less than 24 hrs.Product was well protected and packaged. The actual package was seated atop life jackets type air pockets sleeves all around and under it.Bill has the GSTIN number well printed and legible and the serial number is same on the bill and the Mac book and is legit, as Apples product registration portal confirmed it.Product - its a MacBook, period. Been just a day but so far its running all good.Likely problem , or maybe not , will have to wait and see -1) The machine was half charged at 53% which is fine , but in less than an hours use , it drained 5% . I guess its because it was setting itself up and settings up things etc. and maybe after a full drain followed by a full charge itll begin to hold up better, lets see.2) Apple portal shows warranty to be valid until 6 Dec 2018, thats straight 2 months short of the standard 12 month warranty , which would give me until 23rd Jan 2019 at least !!! Ill write to Amazon about this.Other than that , a perfect machine ! Thanks Amazon !"

Having used it for 3 months I'm just impressed more than ever. I initially thought it would be unable to game as it's a MACBOOK, but to my surprise this laptop is no slouch when it comes to performance. It can easily handle games build around 2k13 at medium setting with decent framerates(bootcamp off course) The battery backup is out of this world. The design is as good as it gets. The display is fairly decent but not something 4k'ish. And it's thinner than anything in competition. In my opinion it is one of the best laptop you could buy at a price of around 50k. Look out for that price drop as it's frequently available here and there."

    "text": "I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU -  Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.[...]! Thanks"

Not sure if amazon sells defects tie products on heavy discounts. I am a frequent and loyal buyer from amazon but I have simply lost trust in them as my almost 55k product has gone for a troll. You are a shame! Mac has also let me down as they were suppose to provide best in class products now what they have in justification is that it shouldn't happen but we will replace the part coz it is in warranty. Imagine had it not been in warranty period, my hard earned money invested on this effing product would have gone into trash. Big thumbs down for amazon India and mac who make fools out of customer and not giving them full satisfaction. Even the executive seated at service centres give least explanation as to how a new product can show such defect. Useless people"

Though the specs of Nikon d3300 was far superior, still I opted for Canon 1300D just for the reason that it has Wifi function and there was a price difference of Rs.4000 between both the models.  I am giving the pros and cons of this camera as per my view :Pros :1.  Great Price ( I got it for less than 26,500 with dual kit lens including cashback)2.  Beautiful reproduction of colour.3.  Inbuilt Wifi - Easier to copy photos from camera to mobile phone.4.  Mobile phone can be used as remove for auto shoot.Cons :1.  Still trying to find.I can safely say it was a good choice.

However, one can also buy decent 50mm prime lens for the cost of Nikon d3400 plus few thousand Rs.Also I would suggest buying camera with one lens (18-55) and buy a 50mm prime lens seperately for those awesome blurry background photos.Features written in description are accurate.

He was emphatically told by the sales rep. there that the battery/battery charger are either fake/counterfeit or they are malfunctioning . He has been going around to Cloudtail Centres but has found any resolution to the problem. Being a journalist a DSLR is a very important accessory for him.

    "text": "I have used all OnePlus devices (1, 2, X, 3, 3T and 5.). OnePlus was an experimental startup project from OPPO and now It has turned into a well-established brand name. All Oneplus devices have the killer hardware at the very reasonable price tag, but we all know that powerful hardware alone not enough to make a good piece of technology, software plays an important role too. iPhone is the example and this is where OnePlus failed in the beginning. OnePlus started with Cyanogen OS then they had to move on Hydrogen & Oxygen OS but last year they started merging both Hydrogen and Oxygen OS and the result can be seen in OnePlus 5's Oxygen OS. In this review, I will share everything about OnePlus 5 and 5T including some good and bad things about OnePlus 5T comparison in both 6GB and 8GB variants based on my experience. So here we go:-------------------------------------- OnePlus 5T 6GB/64GB vs 8GB/128GB--------------------------------------1. IMHO the 6GB RAM is more than enough, the 8GB RAM is a just marketing strategy to grab more attention on their 128GB model, The memory module they used are same and carry the same read/write and copy speed. Hence the performance is same for the both devices.2. You get 52GB user available memory on the 64GB variant and 111GB on the 128GB variant.3. There won't be any visible performance difference in both devices.-------------------------------------- OnePlus 5 vs OnePlus 5T-------------------------------------- 1. OnePlus 5 can capture good zoomed photos but OnePlus 5T captures better low light photos. 2. OnePlus 5 has front FP sensor with home key but OnePlus 5T has rare FP sensor with slide features. 3. OnePlus 5 has lil small screen than OnePlus 5t so battery backup would but lil better in  OnePlus 5. 4. The larger 18:9 aspect ratio screen on the OnePlus 5T provides better productivity than OnePlus 5.---------------------- Box Contents:----------------------1. OnePlus 5T with Pre-Applied Screen Protector.2. Dash Charge Adapter.3. USB Type C Cable (USB to Type C).4. Sim Card Ejector Tool.5. User Manual.6. A message from company Co-founder Carl Pei.7. Some OnePlus stickers.--------------------- The Good:---------------------+ Next generation's 18:9 larger display for better productivity.+ Build quality, this phone has the awesome build quality and beautiful metal construction with the equal weight distribution like old generation's 3 and 3T.+ It looks good in the hand, gives an illusion of iPhone 7 Plus but feels better in hand with iPhone 7 Plus.+ OnePlus 5T gets charged 10% to 70% within an hour with it's Dash Charge. All heat dash charge keep in it and it has the ability to keep OnePlus 5 temperatures low even while fast charging, it is the new charging standard OnePlus created last year for mobile industries.+ Latest lighting fast Snapdragon 835 10nm processor which is 27% faster while consuming 40% less energy, with the overall size being 30% smaller than the previous generation's Snapdragon 820/821.+ Fast 64/128GB UFS 2.1 2-LANE Storage with read & write speed of ~500MB/s & 250MB/s which is 87% faster as compared to old eMMC 5.0 and these are one of the fastest memory modules for smartphones (Faster the memory, lesser the loading and launching time of the apps).+ 6GB/8GB LPDDR4X RAM is also smaller and more power efficient than the previous generation's LPDDR4 RAM.+ One of the fastest fingerprint sensors in smartphones to date.+ All front 16MP and the rear 16MP+20MP camera are Sony sensors and are the best in the class, no shutter lag and takes good pictures in daylight even low light performance is not bad. With this dual camera system, you can get DSLR-like (blur effect/bokeh) photos. Overall best camera experience at this budget.+ NFC Support, I mostly use it to connect my camera to mobile.+ Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX & aptX HD Bluetooth Audio Codecs support.+ The audio output is good, loud and clear tested with Sony XB70AP wired earphones, Bluedio T2 Bluetooth headphones and Moto Deck wireless speakers.+ OnePlus 5T has a mono speaker, located at the bottom so no matter how OnePlus 5 lays it isn't blocked. speaker volume is good but not excellent like OnePlus 2 but better than the Galaxy S8, LG G6 and iPhone 7s plus which cost twice of it.+ Good battery backup with the 3300mAh battery you just need to tweak it a bit.+ Bundled charger and cable quality are awesome. No compromise is done with them.+ Oxygen OS is lightweight and butter smooth. Network speed monitor, Vibration patterns, sRGB display mode, Smart Wi-Fi Switcher, Cool gesture control with additional three new gestures, you can also customize these gestures to launch your fav app quickly, game mode and reading mode are now part of new Oxygen OS and all of these are extremely useful features.+ It has the headphone jack.+ Assembled in India.------------------- The Bad:-------------------- OnePlus is investing too much in advertising and sponsored posts on the internet, and the result is here the price is now no more budget friendly like it used to be with OnePlus 1, 2, X and 3. IMHO now it comes with a premium price tag although it is still cheaper than all flagships that carry same specs.- Design, they just copied iPhone 7 Plus design. I accept that today almost every phone looks alike because of curved shape but they don't just copy the design, look at Huawei dual camera setup, Mi's dual camera setup, LG's dual camera setup and then iPhone 7 Plus and Oneplus 5's camera setup and antenna lines.- Not 2k display in 2017's flagship.- No FM, No IR Blaster, today almost all phones packed with this feature but I don't know why flagships devices like OnePlus 5, Samsung S8 does not have it.- No OIS, this camera doesn't have OIS for video recordings although they are working on it, maybe in future, we will get EIS for 4k in updates.- No dual tone flash. It has only single LED flash.- You can't make video calls without the help of any app as there is no native video calling support for 4G and 3G.- Although it has new smaller and power efficient 6GB/8GB LPDDR4X RAM but the copy speed of this RAM is just half of the previous generation's OnePlus 3/3T's 6GB LPDDR4 RAM. I tested it with A1 SD Bench and results were OnePlus 5 6GB/8GB at ~7000MB/s and OnePlus 3/3T at ~12000MB/s. OnePlus 5T's RAM speed is slower than the most flagship devices in the market.- The Oxygen OS is a bit buggy for this device for now but things will become good by time.- The very delicate device, dropping it once will break it as the glass has no frame around it to protect.- The headphone jack is still on the bottom which is really something not in trend and it makes trouble in holding the device in one hand when earphones are plugged.- No wireless charging.- Now the Accidental Damage Protection is FREE only if you open a Kotak 811 account, if you already have one then you are not eligible for the FREE Accidental Damage Protection.- Playing with emotions of many customers who blindly trust benchmark numbers by Cheating with the benchmarks.- The new Dash Charge adapter is very big, I think it is the biggest that comes with any smartphone.- Really bad after sales services.--------------------- Other Points:---------------------Battery Saving Tip:1. OnePlus 5T has an Optic AMOLED display so keeping the black colour on the screen will save OnePlus 5's battery life. So make a black wallpaper and use dark mode. Additionally, you can install substratum and InversionUI to change everything in black from the play store if you have rooted your device.2. Install and use greenify, people think there is no use of greenify as there is doze mode in Android M but Doze doesn't do anything while your device is in use, whereas Greenify can happily hibernate non-essential apps and boost battery performance.Performance Tweak:Go to phone Settings > About Phone > Hit \"Build number\" 7 times > back to Settings > Developer Options here change animations speed to .5x from 1x or turn them completely off.Issues & Fixes:1. OTG not working. To fix this is to jump into Settings > Advance and from here enable OTG Storage.2. Getting high pitch noise while calling. Open Phone App > hit the three dot > Settings > Call Settings > From here turn off the noise cancellation.Screen Protection:OnePlus 5T has a curved 2.5D display because of that no tempered glass will completely cover it and tempered glass those cover it completely have no glue in the middle of them at the screen area, in this case, there will be a rainbow effect due to gape between the screen and the tempered glass. Most of the covers will also peel off these full tempered glass so I would recommend you to not buy them.I personally use no tempered on this mobile, the pre-applied screen protector is good enough to take care of scratches. I will apply another good quality screen protector(not tempered glass) in one or two months.FREE Accidental Damage Protection:You get accidental and Liquid Damage Protection insurance worth Rs.2000 FREE on opening a Kotak 811Account(to be activated within 15 days) to activate it just follow these steps:Install the Kotak 811 App and Open your 811 DO mention promo code Ref as ONEPLUS and transfer 1000 rupees in that account to be eligible for the offer. Now install OnePlus Care app and fill the required details and wait for the confirmation email from the Servify. If you don't get it then email them with your newly opened account details.Dash Charging:Dash charge only works with the bundled Dash Charge Adapter and the Cable, if you are not using one of them or both then Dash Charge will not work. In other words, Dash Charge works with only bundled Dash Charge Adapter and the Cable.Current While Charging:Some users may feel electric shock/mild vibrating sensation while charging, which is completely normal. This is known as \"current leakage\", and is usually caused by the device being grounded differently than your body is. It happens with many devices like laptops, mobiles, etc. It mostly happens to the devices with the metal frame. OnePlus 5, OnePlus 3/3T both have solid metal construction so using a case will fix the issue.--------------------- VERDICT:---------------------OnePlus had done a great job with OnePlus 3/3T and 5, but with OnePlus 5T they didn't do much. IMHO OnePlus 5T is an incremental update over 3, 3T & 5. It has a great camera, excellent performance, lighting fast FP sensor and the Dash Charge and all these you get in OnePlus 3/3T/5 too. At just 27k and when it comes to performance, OnePlus 3/3T/5/5T beats many flagship smartphones that cost double of it. If you really need a dual camera setup to make your memories more beautiful and you are into photography then you should definitely go for the Oneplus 5T else OnePlus 3/3T is still great option to grab and save money. If you already have OnePlus 5 then upgrade to OnePlus 5T doesn't worth at all.I'm rating OnePlus 5T with 5 stars because of the way it feels in hand, camera quality, dash charge and it still comes with the good price tag than all premium brands.If you have any query or confused about buying this item then feel free to comment here or email me for a quicker response.Thanks for reading my review, I hope it provided all the information for a wise and well-informed purchase decision. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful."

I will not write about anything else here as everything is just superb about the phone but its only the camera which doesn't justify the true worth of this phone.Camera features are all good but its something about the camera lens which is strange because all the photos does tend to have painting like effects and the photos are not that crisp when compared to other phones images. The images does have an upper hand when clicked outdoors with punchy colors but its really the sharpness which isn't there. The camera have recieved an OTA update in the past which improved the camera image quality a bit but still the images are not that crisp.Night images which OnePlus claims To have improved with the secondary lens is OK but nothing great.Overall I am satisfied with the way the phone looks, works, screen display, overall fit and finish but the camera department disappoints in a big way."

    "text": "I think oneplus is underrated. They should be in the list of top Android phones. My personal experience with oneplus made me feel that it's way better than any of the *big names* out there.  I was an iPhone user, but oneplus brought me back to Android because of it's easy UI, almost stock Android and latest software at the most reasonable price which I couldn't find in other big companies. Of course, it's not free of flaws, no phone is perfect, not even the most expensive ones, but the flaws aren't do big that I can't manage.Pros1. Almost stock Android.2. Oxygen OS is the best skin among all other custom skins. It's simple, fluid and has all the things necessary to make life easier like LED notification, dark mode, different display mode, reading mode, and also the most fluid launcher.3. Display quality is superb. Viewing angles are good. I pinch to zoom in YouTube videos and they always fill up the screen so the experience is great. Also as I love reading on my phone a lot, the reading mode with AMOLED display saves my eyes from strain.4. Beautiful to hold. Now this can be personal, but I simply love the look and feel of this phone in my hand.5. Battery life is great. Always manage a day with full WiFi usage. I have used both high end Android and Apple phones before, and I can safely say that I find the battery life of oneplus 5t better than any of them.6. Parallel app. I know there are apps in play store for the same but I prefer when a company provides something in built rather then downloading a third party app. This feature is seriously handy.7. Customer service. Again this can be personal, but my experience with oneplus customer support has always been easy, quick and satisfying. They always seem to be eager to help.8. Fast charger. I know there are phones with fast charger and wireless charger out there, but at this price segment, oneplus dash charger is best out there. It changed from 29 percent to 60 percent in three minutes.Cons-No phone is without them1. Camera. Yes it has the potrait mode, but it needs huge improvements. It's not good. EIS is not better than OIS. Videos can be shaky. Low light images still appear blurry. Hope they do provide a software update soon.2. Updates. Again this is personal, but I hate the long waiting update cycles. They need to provide better software updates timely. Also take long time in oxygen updates and Android updates. I know they want to test them before rolling out, but the waiting is too long for my anxious mind.I am loving this phone from day one. In this price range I am getting a bazel less hd+ AMOLED snapdragon 835 with 6 GB ram with Oreo update coming up. Also with dual SIM facility. And I am loving it."

One thing for sure the device is blazing fast and battery is optimized to last long plus if you are falling short of juice, it takes the dash charger only 40 mins from 0 to 100 % to charge fully. The device comes with multi option to customize the usage with shortcuts. Display is good and the processor doesn't let you down whatever thrown at it. The reception is great and call clarity is treat to the ears, even the phone bottom firing speaker is loud enough to make your interact handsfree. The only little complain is the display screen quality is little let down when compared with Moto or Samsung. No additional memory option is minus.Overall a great phone!"

The display is really good. QHD could have been better as this is 2017. The phone is slick and the build quality is excellent. Multitasking is very fast and RAM management is also excellent. Camera is good not great. Speaker is good and loud and quality is good as well. But stereo speakers could have been better. Dash charging is mind blowing. Only draw back in this phone is you don't get the unread counts in the apps. Otherwise just fantastic phone at 30k plus. Highly recommended."

My phone is full of selfies of all my friends!! Face unlock and finger print scanner are super fast and very convenient. Battery life is very good lasts more than a day easily an I watch a lot of YouTube and also game a lot. You can easily watch complete movies without looking for charger which btw is also out of this world , dash charging is so fast you will pinch yourself. The screen is beautiful and visibility even under the sun is very good. The OS is what I really like, I like the minimalistic approach as I'm a fan of custom roms. Basically everything is amazing about this phone.  Cons this is a bit silly but I prefer the headphone jack to be on top rather than bottom. Also you will have to hide this phone in public because after a point it gets annoying that everybody wants to see it and it's just unhygienic.

With one plus dash charger it takes one hour 30 minutes of time to charge fully. And within 15 minutes of time it is able to charge 37 % which is a good thing.3. Sound speakers are awesome and loud.4. Design is superb slim and sleek design.5. Performance wise equal to iphone X6. Worth of every pennyCons.1. if it has dolby atmos feature then it will be more awesome.2. Kindly keep other one plus mobiles in stock so that the people who cant afford for higher price can go with lower models.3. Try to improvise the battery backup.4. Kindly add earphones with mobile."

Good volume on phone speaker ( for call, not for music). I have never more than 40%. Super fast Fingerprint and Face recognition. At times makes you wonder if it was locked or not..

    "text": "Here is my review after a week's use.What I like:1. Zero lag, no sluggishness, super quick response even with 80 odd Apps installed. I have a 6GB/64GB OP5T phone.2. Overall quality build. Looks premium3. Very good camera. Excellent low light performance. Portrait mode is impressive - photos can be now taken with only the desired object in focus.4. Dash charge. Almost 2% charging rate per minute. No more over night charging for me. I just need to charge for an hour in the morning and I am done for the day.5. Decent battery life. After having used the 5000mAh Asus Zenfone, I was skeptical about 3300mAh battery of OP5T. But I am pleasantly surprised by the battery life of this phone. It lasts nearly as long as my previous phone. At the end of the day, I used to have ~50% charge in my earlier phone while I get ~40%in this phone. Not bad at all, given that this 10% shortfall means only 5 minutes charging time.What I don't like:1. Audio response not upto mark. Low frequency response seems to be rolling off fast. My previous phone was Asus Zenfone max. The music quality of OP5T is not comparable to Zenfon. I am disappointed.What could be improved (by software update or otherwise):1. I am missing the 'unread message count' flag on the Apps like Whatsapp and SMS and mail tools. The OP5T launcher must be upgraded to include this. I don't want to install another launcher just for this.2. Pull down notification window is not vibrant enough. What I mean is that the notification messages from different Apps are not distinctly visible. It takes some time to make out which one is for what. Clear border could be marked between the notifications, more colors could be added. Notification window it's something that I want to see every time I pick up the phone - so this is  important."

As an iPhone user for more than 6 years, I decided to a give a try to this called beast flagship.As I live in Singapore, there are no official Oneplus stores so I bought it from Amazon India.I had barely used the mobile for less than 3 weeks and it stopped working suddenly. It is in pristine condition.So I sent the mobile to Chennai Oneplus service centre on the 27/01/2018 and till today there is no proper response from the Service centre. I had called the service centre from Singapore mutiple times and the mobile has not been serviced.The worst after sales support from Oneplus Service centre. Many of the times, nobody attends the calls and no proper reason is given for the faulty handset.Till today as of 04/02/2018, I have received the mobile services.If you want to consider buying Oneplus mobiles, do consider after sales especially Chennai Service centre.It sucks and even the chat supports sucks and I dont know what they do. They cant even resolve any issues.I am not hater of Oneplus but the after sales drive me nuts."

Superb display3. Really good camera both front and back (I am not a camera expert, so can't give detailed feedback :))4. Finger print scanner and face unlock work great and really fast.5. Phone doesn't heat up even during charging and charges from 20 to 90 in about an hour.Cons:1. Seems to download whatsapp and other notifications even when data and wi-fi are off (seems to be a bug, which hopefully will be fixed soon)2. For people moving from a smaller size phone, the large screen might take time to get used to.3. Whatsapp LED notification doesn't work when we remove the sound & vibrate, and just keep LED light customization, had to reset whatsapp notification settings to make it work.4. LED notification light is not as strong as other phones and might take time to notice it.5. App notification counter is missing, hopefully they will add it in the next update.If your budget is around 30k, blindly go for it. If you can spare the extra 15-20k, then you can checkout the pixel 2. I saw the iphone X and it wasn't much better compared to the 5t, so total value for money when you compare how much the iphone X costs."

Yes it works! The portrait mode is \"decent\". Don't expect too much from that.- Actual storage you'll receive is 111GB which is as big as it gets. I don't particularly store a lot of things in my phone but 83 apps installed and it's running pretty well with no glitches.- 8GB RAM is definitely worth it (Opened all the apps simultaneously without closing and the phone was still functioning with no setbacks)- Very many ways of customization and the display is simply AMAZING!- Finger print sensor and face scanner unlock works within less than a blink's time. It's super effective!All in all, within the price range, the features and style makes it all up! My favorite phone yet."

SUPER sensitive and produce sharp images. The 18:9 screen ratio is just perfect for watching movies!!***Has reading mode to read books(helpful those who use Kindle app) without putting any stress on the eyes.* Battery life is commendable..last a day on heavy usage.***One of the issues- protruding rear camera lenses : please be careful while placing the phone on hard surfaces. Also the phone design is slick- use a good back cover!!!***********No earphones in the accessories************ Not water resistant and scratch proof.  Although, it comes with Gorilla Glass 5, few accidental low - level drops won't do any damage to the screen.Using this beast for a month and found no other issues than I mentioned here.

There are many gestures which are awesome and the finger print scanner is amazing it unlocks at lighting speed . If you are an android lover and stop looking here and there just go for it . Also the camera is good with he new oxygen update has enhanced the optical stabilisation by which I can take steady video even while moving . One of the best things is if u want any software enhancement u keep it in the o eplus forums inbuilt app and if they like your recommendation they would add that feature in the upcoming update .Overall this is \"THE BEST PHONE EVER\""

Camera quality is one of it's USP.4. Dash charging can get a 75% charge, just in 15 mins from 0% battery.5. Face recognition is working absolutely fine and touch sensor at back is neatly made.Cons:1.

Not really happy with the camera though, color reproduction is sometimes poor and depth effects is a hit or miss, with the images looking cropped using Photoshop or something. Low light shots are a bit of a let down too unfortunately.Having said all that, I love this device. Overall performance is A+ for 1+ 5t."

Great phone it can do any task which we throw the only downside is the camera algorithms camera is good but after processing in certain cases are quite aggressive which finally results in some cartoonish effect. Rest wil gove 5 stars as software bugs can be resolved. Get the 6gb variant as there is not a big difference between the speed.

They send me a new and original Strontium Nitro 32GB 70MB/s UHS-1 Class 10 and the same is the best quality memory card and it works good and also send a Strontium Company Calendar 2017 along with memory card.Heartly thanks to Strontium CompanyI give five starsBecause The Strontium Company replaced the defected memory card (warranty claimed for this)I bought another Strontium 32GB MicroSDHC Memory Card (Class 10) on last about two years and the same is working good till today.Don't go for other brands ................ Strontium is the BESTThanks ...."

(sequential 71MB/s read, 20MB/s write  and random 5MB/s read, 0.9MB/s write) . I am more interested in reliable operation and low power consumption than raw speeds .

About the product the product is best inits price I have bought this for Rs 1649 but the MRP written is rs 3695.# Functionality:- 1) It's digital cum analogue watch so you can set two time zones.  2) Indiglo feature its the best feature all expedition series have this feature.  3) Hourly beep the hourly beep is very loud and I like that.  4) Alarm, stopwatch & timer.The glass of the dial is made up of Mineral glass and it can survive bumps and falls and its quite scratch resistance.Go for it if you find this watch less than 2k.THANK YOU for reading my review.

Since then i have been calling tcl customer service, speaking to all the team leaders, and finally i got to the head of the technical department Mr. Balwant. Its been 4 months since then that ive been following up on this matter. He assured me that thr amount will be refunded, took my account details n kept telling me for 2 months that the amount has been transferred to my account. I knew there was something fishy. So i called up the call  center again  to check. They informed me that the refund was never sanctioned by the higher authorities. So on questioning Mr. Balwant, he puts me through some person called jeetender to claims to be the head of balwant, he promised me a call back after looking into the matter. On calling him several times he says the transfer of he amount has been cancelled bcos of gst. Isnt it funny? I called him up again he said he wasnt in office n again promised a call back which never happened. N evrytime i call him he disconnects my call. So people please think 1000 times before purchasing this product. Its been 4 monyhs n im still struggling to even talk to the right person in tcl. Right from the call center level to the managerial level....all r just fooling their customers."

Glad that I have crossed 3 months. Will update after 6 months!Product Review:~~~~~~~~~~~If at all Amazon hadn't given this for such a low price of less than 9000/- I wouldn't have purchased it, reason being too many poor rating for it's after sale service. Though the add-on pack for free installation couldn't be added to Chennai location, still I had the option of choosing the free installation at the check out menu. Luckily TCL service is nearby my locality in Chennai, hoping I don't have to run around.Actual Cost : 12990/-Deal price : 10990/-Discounts: 10% with 1000 cashback as Amazon PayBox contents:~~~~~~~~~~TV Unit  x 1Table Stand set x 1Remote x 1Warranty card & User manual x 1Wall Mount:~~~~~~~~ No call back, I had to request repeatedly for installation. Have to register with them through calling their customer care for warranty Call and confirm the installation. Basic wall mount would be provided free of cost with installation.--Took 2 days to complete the installationSome highlights~~~~~~~~~~~~ Little over thin bezels, look great Ports: VGA, HDMI (2), USB (2), Component IN, Audio IN (DVD/PC), SPDIF, Antenna IN, Audio out (Amplifiers) 2 speakers in built in TV, decent if not great for voice Audio out port gives good clarity of sound when played musics (TV pre-amp is good) Graphic spectrum for music player is just for showpiece and don't expect any Plays MKV, MP3, avi, MP4, but 1080p is little overload for this TV Picture quality is decent (for a 720p) for a 10K price and no complaints For warranty claim (Note, slip is not sealed or attested) Amazon invoice bill is mandatory and you need to call them PC using 720p (1280) resolution at 32inch may not be pleasing !Picture quality is decent for its asking price and I have no complaints. Color reproduction is precise and sharp for a 720p panel. Plus, you wouldn't expect more from a 720p as the telecast from set top boxes doesn't exceed beyond 720p resolution, it is a proper balance.Final words:~~~~~~~~I may not recommend this product though it has served well for me, as a matter of fact after sales service is very important and this TV seriously lacks. It is only the pricing and cashback that lures the customers and I did fall for that. At slightly less than 9000, this TV is not a hole in my pocket and all I expect is 1 to 2 years time to work. If you still would like to, then make sure you have access to TCL Service in your town nearby and if you get special offers below 9K which can help you come out of vex later.Hope it helpsIf this review is of any helpful, consider making it more helpful for others."

He tried to fleece money by telling me that wall mount installation is chargeable (yes even the basic standard installation with no fancy wall mount). I have call recording with me if Amazon or TCL needs for corrective actions. I told him to come over and do it. Then he came with a cheap, rusty huge wall mount. He tried to install it but after keeping the TV upside down on a table (without any protection to avoid scratches), then he realised that the wall mount is not compatible with my TV. The way he handled the TV was not at all professional (video recording available) .After various calls to Amazon and TCL, today (25th Sep), someone called me that it will be installed by 12:30.

After a long battle of five days the TV is installed today on 6th July . But still the TV is showings \"NO SIGNAL \" message. I have three connection of Tata sky and other are perfectly showing different channel but this TV is not. A great shock for me."

This TV is working great without any issues and I liked it for it's cinematic look. I have two branded LED TVs and I never really liked the \"Digital\" look I feel on those TVs. But while watching movies on English HD channels, I get cinematic feel on TCL. Maybe because it's me being in cinematography field, I notice it more than regular users. The sound quality is good enough. Only thing I really did not like is about the installation support. The installation guys never really turned up. That's why I am giving one star less. Otherwise, it's a superb TV."

Product quality is excellent. I will post detailed review after a few days of use it but one major fact about this tv is that you should have HD content to play like HD set top box or bluray dvd player or any good quality android smart tv box. Unfortunately, at the moment I have only android smart tv box with me and I am watching all major international tv chanells in HD format and very much satisfied."

The chart is perfect without any error. Measure Ur head with a string and align it with tape to get exact head circumference then choose the size. M size is 58cm.

The visor slides up and down not very smoothly.  Happy with all other aspects such as ft, appearance, sturdiness, general comfort except the ventilation."

A tall person has to bend too much to wipe the floor. The locking system unlocks while wiping the floor, hence the length of the handle becomes very short.
